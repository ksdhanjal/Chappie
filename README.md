# Chappie : Android application for Q/A

Chappie is a question answering app which enables users to ask question about virtually anything (related to the data that has been fed to the machine learning model)

## Working

- The app lets user ask a question either by voice (with the help of Google's TextToSpeech) or by manually typing it
- Then it sends the question to the server via an HTTP request
- Server then processes it and returns the answer in JSON
- App then parses it and shows it on the screen and plays it back
